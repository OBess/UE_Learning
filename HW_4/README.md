# HW 4

## Work with lighting

In this homework, two maps were created where I use lights. On the first map `NeonWords_Map` I use a Spot Light for the start point of player with a little configurations, and create a 'neon'-sticks with Point Light - for 'neon'-sticks were created a blueprint and a material.

On the second map `Sky_Map` I just use a plugin `Sun Position Calculator` and a Rect Light for light letters.

Also, I have made two maps (Lighting_PPV, Lighting_Types) from tasks where I work with Post Processing Volume and tried different types of lights.
