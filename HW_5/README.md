# HW 5

## Work with animations

In this homework was created a state machine. I used animations from UE5 "Third Person" project template. In the state machine, I created five states ("Idle", "Walk", "Run", "Jump", "Fall Loop"), and all of them are related to an enumeration "Enum_States". All changes in the current state occur from Events of "ABP_Anim" and "BP_ThirdPersonCharacter" blueprints.
